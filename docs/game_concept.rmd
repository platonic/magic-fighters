**Game Concept Document**

Introduction
------------

Magic Fighters is a 2D RPG Adventure that takes the Street Fighter fighting experience and adds a dynamic storyline style like Metroid. The basic idea comes from Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks where the player can pick different characters to beat the level in an adventure style. I will be using Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0.

Description
You as the player can pick from eight characters out of the twelve characters on Street Fighter II. Depending on the character you select the story will be different similar to the story for the same character on Street Fighter II. Once you select the character you will be able to play as a regular RPG Adventure with your character and gain all the characters moves as you level up and unlock the different skills.
One minor difference here is that you will be able to learn the enemies’ attacks once you defeat them. Just like many RPGs out there, you will be able to select a class for the character. The main classes will be: Warrior, Thief, Paladin, Mage (with both white and black magic), Beastmaster, Defender and Mediator.
·         Warrior: Attacks with various techniques but is very limited in magic.
·         Thief: This thief can steal equipped items, coins, and experience points.
·         Paladin: Combines physical strength with white magic and can cover allies. Paladins are much like Knights, except for one key difference - they have white magic and can cover allies. (High defense, high HP, low magic, low attack power)
·         Mage: Uses magic to heal oneself, allies or poison enemies.
·         Beastmaster: Controls other monsters
·         Defender: Combines White Magic with heavy offense. (High HP, high defense, low MP, low magic power)
·         Mediator: This class can either manipulate enemies from battle, or capture a weakened monster and release it later for a single attack (kind of like Pokemon). The CornaJar accessory allows you to capture monsters with 1/2 or lower HP.

Blanka:
Blanka's background story is expanded/rewritten in the Street Fighter Alpha series. In his Street Fighter II ending, he reunites with his mother who recognizes him from the anklets he wears. She reveals that Blanka was once known as Jimmy, before he was in a plane crash as a little boy. This crash caused him to grow up in the wild, although he has connections to a local village. Ever since the crash, Blanka/Jimmy had been separated from his mother. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
Chun-Li
Chun-Li was an Interpol investigator who had been searching for clues to the recent death of her father. During a friendly spar with an old teacher of hers and friend of her father, Gen, she received a clue as to who may have been behind her father's death—the mysterious crime syndicate Shadoloo. Chun-Li tracked down the syndicate's leader, M. Bison, and demanded that he tell her what happened to her father. Bison attacked and defeated her, then flew away laughing, telling her that if she attacked him again he would kill her just like he did her father. With tears in her eyes, Chun-Li swore vengeance.
        	After the events depicted in the Street Fighter Alpha series, Chun-Li received an invitation to the second World Warrior tournament, and discovered that Bison had apparently survived his Thailand base's destruction. With this, she had the clear motive of destroying Shadoloo and avenging her father once again. The outcome of this tournament is not clear, but there are strong hints that Chun-Li earned the right to face Bison and possibly won the tournament, though Guile has also been suspected to have been the victor. There has been no definitive answer as of yet, although regardless of the outcome, Bison himself finally falls at the hands of Ryu's nemesis, Akuma. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
Dhalsim:
Dhalsim hails from Kerala, India. He is often depicted as having pupil-less eyes. His build is that of a normal man who exercises and weight trains regularly except for his abdomen and waist which appear much out of proportion and emaciated. He wears torn saffron shorts as his only clothing attire as well as saffron wristbands and anklebands. He has three coloured stripes adorning his head. The skulls he wears around his neck are those of village children that died during a plague. In palette swap renditions of Dhalsim, his skin is often dark blue or other unnatural colors. He is the oldest of the original World Warriors.
Generally a pacifist, Dhalsim fights to raise money for his village, but realizes that it might contradict his pacifist beliefs. The only significant part he played in the overall story of the series was to make Cammy self-aware.
Dhalsim has the power to suspend himself in mid-air, stretch his extremities in ways beyond the average human, read minds, and sense evil, the latter abilities he uses to locate the sinister M. Bison, and doing his part to aid those who can defeat the villain. He retired from fighting after the second World Warrior tournament, and continued to roam the world helping those in need. In many additional storylines, he aids Ryu in his quest to become stronger and defeat evildoers. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
 
 
Edmond Honda:
E. Honda began his training as a child, singularly focused on becoming the greatest sumo wrestler of all time. He would eventually achieve the highly-revered titled of "Ōzeki" (in the English localization, he was incorrectly stated as having achieved the title, Yokozuna). E. Honda became upset that the rest of the world did not view sumo wrestling with the reverence of the Japanese. He entered into the second World Warrior tournament intent on showing everyone that sumo wrestlers rank among the greatest fighters in the world. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
Guile:
Holding Bison responsible for the death of his best friend, Guile seemingly dedicates his whole life to exact revenge on Bison, who had by then somehow survived the explosion. A court case against the Shadaloo dictator failed when Bison bribed all the judges to let him go free. Bison by this time wanted revenge on Guile, Chun-Li, and many other people who had hindered his syndicate's efforts. To this end, he set up the second World Warrior tournament to trap them.
        	When Guile was a Lieutenant in the United States Air Force, he befriended his superior officer, Charlie and asked Charlie to teach him his unique form of fighting, which Charlie agreed to do. Guile learned the style, but his hot temper caused him to be not as proficient in the moves as Charlie was (shown in how Charlie can shoot sonic booms with just one hand and Guile needs both).
        	Although the circumstances on how Guile approached Bison is sketchy, he managed to corner Bison and asked him if he remembered him or his friend Charlie. While Guile threatens the defeated Bison with the intent to kill him, he is stopped.
        	Guile's wife Julie, and daughter Amy, appear and urge him not to kill the psychotic dictator, claiming that such behavior could destroy him. They tell him that the past is in the past and that he doesn't have to give up his life of revenge. Realizing they are correct, he abandons his pursuit of Bison and retires happily to be with his family. Also, Julia and Eliza are actually sisters, making Ken and Guile brothers-in-law. However, this is not often discussed because Guile does not think very highly of Ken, believing him to be a spoiled rich kid. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
Ken:
When Ken was about 12 years old, his father, a rich hotel tycoon, thought that his son needed to learn about discipline, lest his son become a spoiled brat all of his life and try to leech onto the Masters' family fortune. In order to do so, the elder Masters sent Ken to Japan to train under his best friend, the mysterious karate master Gouken. At first, Ken was very hesitant to learn from Gouken, wanting to go back to the United States, but later began to respect his master. He even enjoyed the company of Gouken's adopted son, Ryu, since he had a foil to finally pull pranks on, although this got Ken into a lot of trouble. Ryu and Ken would later become best friends and each other's principal rivals.
When Ryu was 23, Gouken decided that both of his pupils had grown up to be fine fighters and decided that their training was over and they could now leave the dojo. Ryu decided to travel the world in order to continue his training, whereas Ken was finally happy to be going back home to the United States after his years of straining his back for master Gouken and finally learning the meaning of humility. After coming home, Ken competed in many different Martial Arts tournaments held in the United States, winning most of them.
 
Ken did not participate in the first Street Fighter tournament; instead, he fought in (and won) the premiere U.S. Martial Arts tournament that had been previously won by Charlie, as well as meeting a very attractive girl named Eliza, who became his girlfriend. After winning the U.S. martial arts tournament, Ken returned to his training ground to tell his master Gouken the good news. There he witnessed his master's death at the hands of Akuma. Enraged and grief stricken, he attacked Akuma, only to be defeated.
 
Ken received an invitation to the second Street Fighter tournament, but since his last U.S. Martial Arts tournament, he had let himself spend too much time with his girlfriend, Eliza, rather than training. Only Ryu's personal challenge rekindled Ken's fighting spirit and persuaded him to enter the second World Warrior tournament. After the events of Street Fighter II, Ken is married to Eliza, something he vowed only to do after winning a decisive victory against Ryu. However it is unknown if the two fought during the tournament, or if Ken actually won. No details have been stated. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
Ryu:
Ryu was an orphaned child, with no knowledge of who his parents were or if they are still alive. When Ryu was a young child, he was adopted by a man named Gouken and began living with him as well as learning a mysterious martial art. Gouken would later train his best friend's bratty son, Ken Masters, who served not only as a sparring partner for Ryu, but also to give Ryu some company since Gouken was the only person Ryu had seen in a long time due to the seclusion of Gouken's dojo. Ryu looked up to Gouken as a father figure during his early years and Ken as a best friend and surrogate brother, which is how their relationship remains to this day. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
When Ryu was about 23 years old, Gouken thought that Ryu was ready to travel the world in order to test his skills against the best fighters in the world. With this, Ryu leaves Gouken and Ken, and heads to fight in the first World Warrior tournament. After defeating all challengers, his skills earn him the right to fight its host, Sagat. Despite nearly losing against the "Dark Emperor of Muay Thai," Ryu secures a difficult victory, and is crowned champion. Years later, after the events depicted in the Street Fighter Alpha series, Ryu enters the second World Warrior tournament to test his skills. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
Zangief
Zangief is said to have trained by wrestling polar bears in Siberia, on which he practiced his trademark Spinning Piledriver after being picked up by a cyclone while performing a piledriver on a bear. The scars covering his body are said to have been the results of wrestling with bears.
As the greatest professional wrestler in the Soviet Union, Zangief was contacted by a man named Erai Hito (Great Man) to represent his country in the second World Warrior tournament. Zangief agreed and began training in the extreme climates of Siberia, determined to demonstrate Russia's magnificent power to all of the world. With the assistance of his government, Zangief emerged from his training as "The Red Cyclone."
In his ending in the Street Fighter II series, Zangief is congratulated by someone who greatly resembles former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev and dances with him. He is referred to as erai hito (or "great man") in the Japanese version. In later versions of the Street Fighter II series, Zangief calls him "Mr. Ex-President". (StrategyWiki, n/a)
Balrog:
Balrog was once a great boxing champion and prize fighter. He was banned from boxing for permanently injuring his opponents (as well as for his illegal maneuvers, particularly his headbutt), so he joined the Shadoloo criminal organization, and worked his way up from the bottom, eventually becoming Bison's enforcer. While running errands for M. Bison (Vega in Japan), he killed Dhalsim's elephant with a single Gigaton Punch. In one mission, Balrog was sent to terminate Birdie. Although he did not know why, Balrog went anyway. Birdie told him about the Psycho Drive, and Balrog agreed to help him find it, thinking he could make money from it. When the Psycho Drive exploded, Balrog realized that he had not been paid recently. When M. Bison was killed at the hands of Akuma, ownership of Shadoloo was transferred to the former prize fighter. Unfortunately, he ended up running the entire organization into the ground in no time. After the fall of Shadoloo, Balrog became nothing more than a bum on the streets. (StrategyWiki, n/a)

Vega:
Vega was born to a privileged Catalonian family in Spain. For reasons undisclosed, their status dwindled, causing Vega's mother to remarry for financial security. As he matured, Vega studied bullfighting, a cultural tradition. Afterward, he went to Japan and learned ninjutsu, a style he believed meshed well with his natural grace and agility. Combining bullfighting with ninjutsu, Vega went into an underground cage fighting circuit, and quickly became one of the best. His stepfather murdered his mother because he felt she did not respect him, and Vega killed him in return. The incident warped his mind, and he developed a dual personality: honorable nobleman by day, sadistic murderer by night.
Due to Vega's superb fighting ability and remorseless nature, the criminal leader known as M. Bison instated Vega as one of his three personal grand master bodyguards in the Shadoloo organization. Vega oversaw assassination operations for Shadoloo as well, and was associated with Cammy and the Shadoloo assassins known as The Dolls. Despite his savage and brutal fighting ability, Vega failed to protect Bison's secret Psycho Drive project. It is unknown what Vega has been doing since the fall of Shadoloo, although it's assumed he still continues his murderous rampages. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
Sagat:
Sagat won the title of Emperor/God of Muay Thai from Nuah Kahn as a teenager, and became a national hero in Thailand. He defended his title from a fighter named Go Hibiki, in a match that cost Sagat the use of his right eye, and cost Go his life. Go's son, Dan, swore revenge on Sagat.
Sagat trained Adon, and held the first World Warrior tournament to prove that he was not only the strongest Muay Thai kickboxer, but the strongest fighter in the world. Only one fighter managed to reach Sagat: a young martial artist named Ryu. Initially, Sagat was able to pin Ryu, and was sure that he was the winner of the match. However, Ryu became desperate to win the fight and was consumed by the Satsui No Hadou and executed the Metsu Shoryuken, grievously wounding Sagat and leaving a massive scar across his chest. Because of this event, Sagat has sworn revenge on Ryu. The massive scar on his chest is a constant reminder of Ryu's victory. Sagat makes no attempt to conceal the disfigurement, and in fact draws power from the hateful memory it invokes.
While Sagat's goal in the second World Warrior tournament was a clean rematch with Ryu, his hopes were eclipsed when Ryu had been knocked out of the competition, therefore he dropped before his next match. Sagat is still a member of Shadaloo, as he is fought second to M. Bison, and continues to train his body and mind in Thailand, hoping to become the world's strongest fighter before he becomes too old to do so. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
M. Bison:
Next to nothing is known about Bison's youth and his early years, even as to when he was born (most game manuals list his birth year as unknown), but he appears to be in his late 40's to mid 50's although he could be much older - some speculate he is above the 100's despite his not-so-old appearance. His first appearance, chronologically speaking, was in Street Fighter Alpha, as the head of an elusive criminal and military organization known as Shadoloo. Along with his aspirations for world conquest, M. Bison had been working on perfecting a lethal and deadly energy that would exponentially increase his fighting ability, an inherently evil energy he refers to as "Psycho Power".
M. Bison held the second Street Fighter tournament to get revenge against the people who had destroyed the Psycho Drive. His new body was much weaker than the previous, but he was still very powerful. In the end, he was destroyed by Akuma, who killed him with the Shun Goku Satsu and sent his soul to hell to be destroyed. Bison was not heard of in Street Fighter III, and Chun-Li's mid-boss dialogue with Urien in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike suggests that Shadoloo was destroyed. (StrategyWiki, n/a)
